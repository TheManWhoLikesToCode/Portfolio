## Description
Hello! I'm Jaydin Freeman and welcome to the first edition of my portfolio website. This space serves as a high-level overview of my journey in computer science, featuring my projects and work experiences. The website is crafted using HTML, CSS, and JS for a simple and elegant user experience.

Navigate through four key sections - Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact. In "About", learn briefly about my background. "Portfolio" showcases my projects and work experiences, including a highlight on the "BlackBoard Scrapper" project and my stint at BorgWarner. For getting in touch, youâ€™ll find my email in the "Contact" section.

Also, connect with me on LinkedIn and GitHub through links in the navigation bar.

Thank you for stopping by!
