                        <b1>Hi there! My name is Jaydin, and I am currently a
                            computer science student at kettering
                            University. In my free time, I enjoy coding,
                            playing basketball, and cooking. I first started
                            learning how to code in my freshman year of
                            college, and since then I have become proficient
                            in a variety of programming languages, including
                            Java, Python, Matlab, HTML, and CSS. I am
                            excited to continue learning and growing as a
                            programmer, and to see where my passion for
                            technology will take me.</b1>

                        <h3>BlackBoard Scrapper</h3>
                        <b2>The Blackboard Scrapper is a tool for students to easily archive and track their course
                            materials and grades from Blackboard. It helps students store and organize their coursework
                            for long-term access and reference. This scraper is useful for college students preserving
                            their academic record and high schoolers preparing for future studies.-

                            This web scraper is specifically designed for kettering University students to extract their
                            course information from the Blackboard login page. It uses the Selenium webdriver and Python
                            to automate the login process and extract the necessary data. Please note that this tool is
                            only intended for use by kettering University students. I apologize for any inconvenience
                            this may cause to users from other institutions.</b2>
